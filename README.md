This is my Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project.

The goal is to create a grid of elements via Javascript and insert them into the page.

The number of elements inside this grid should be customizable by the user. The container size should not change.

I added a random color mode (optional challenge) which changes the triggered div's background color to a random hexidecimal value.

Noticable lag was introduced in the mid-three-digit grid sizes, so it's capped to 250 upon submit.

This is also the first time I've used Javascript modules. I would use Webpack on a production run, since the support for modules is still lacking.
